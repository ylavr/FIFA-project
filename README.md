## The challenge

Perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what you have learned so far. You will apply statistical or machine learning techniques and present your results to the class.

### Possible Outcomes

- Rank players by market value.
- Highlight the top players for their outstanding performances over a discrete season.
- Decide when to transfer a player.
- Decide the best replacement for a transferred player.

> You might suggest your own outcomes. Check with instructional staff before committing to a new option.

## Objectives

- Ask interesting and thoughtful questions and find the data to answer them.
- Focus on improving in areas that are hard for you or learning more about something with which you feel comfortable.
- Apply the statistical and machine learning techniques we have learned.
- Create useful and clear graphs.
- Present your insights in a thoughtful, clear, and accurate way.

## Dataset

In this project, you will use the provided [fifa23_players_dataset](https://github.com/ta-data-pt-rmt/project-fifa-moneyball/blob/main/fifa_23_male.zip) dataset.

Details about the dataset can be found here as well [kaggle description](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset/)

In case you want to find more information on how each column relates to a player, take a look at this website [sofifa website](https://sofifa.com/player/252371)

## Instructions & Scope

- You **must plan your project.** Creating a Kanban or using [Trello](https://trello.com/) or a similar app for a digital board is mandatory.
- You **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
- Create a `*.gitignore*` file and include it in your repository.
- As an optional you can include a linear regression as a way to answer question(s) on the data.

## Deliverables

- A well-commented Jupyter notebook with your analysis.
- The final dataset after all cleaning and transformations.
- Repository with your workflow + documentation + code.
- Visual documentation of Kanban or Trello board link.

## Tips & Tricks

- Organize yourself (don't get lost!). Respect deadlines.
- Ask for help but don't forget that Google is your friend.
- Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you. :wink:
- Document your work.
- Learn about the problem and what research has been done before you.
- Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
